# Agent instructions for ServeReedley

This repo uses a **tool-agnostic** agent workflow. Full architecture, do-not-edit list, and step-by-step workflows live in the following (canonical) docs:

- **Entrypoint:** [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - project one-liner, critical constraints, and links to all context
- **Full context:** [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - repo overview, tech stack, build/test commands, directory structure, key files, GraphQL/Lambda notes, testing guidelines, common issues
- **Workflows:** [docs/workflows/](../docs/workflows/) - [UPDATE_GRAPHQL_MODEL.md](../docs/workflows/UPDATE_GRAPHQL_MODEL.md) (complete codegen and verify before UX); [NEW_UX_WITH_GRAPHQL_MODEL.md](../docs/workflows/NEW_UX_WITH_GRAPHQL_MODEL.md) (UX only after model change is verified). Lambda: edit under amplify/backend/function/&lt;name&gt;/src/, run npm install there if deps changed.

When working in this repo, read AGENTS.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (and the relevant workflow under docs/workflows/) for full context.

## Short summary (for inline use)

- **Project:** AWS Amplify full-stack CRN app (React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, MUI). Coordinators manage need requests; public submits requests.
- **Build:** `npm install` then `npm start` or `npm run build`. Requires `src/aws-exports.js` (gitignored; use mock for local dev - see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Tests:** `npm test` (Vitest). Four tests in App.test.tsx and TeamList.test.tsx.
- **Do not edit:** `src/API.ts`, `src/graphql/*.ts` (generated by `amplify push`). Schema: `amplify/backend/api/crn/schema.graphql`.
- **Lambdas:** Each under `amplify/backend/function/<name>/src/` has its own `package.json`; run `npm install` in that `src/` when changing deps or code.

For anything not covered above, use [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) as the source of truth.
